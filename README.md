# grisp_auto_link

## What is this?

A GRiSP application that tries to connect to GRiSP.io, and link the device.

This app has been thought to be serviced to the user through the GRiSP.io device web view.

GRiSP.io will fill the sys.config of this app with a valid token and offer the deployed app to the user in a zip file.

You are expected to copy the zip content on an SD card and use it on the board.
Then connect the board to the internet via ethernet and just see its device get linked automatically on the web page.
